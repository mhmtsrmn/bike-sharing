# bike-sharing

This project is a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree curriculum. The project is 
the implementation of neural network from scratch, i.e., using only Numpy package for 
calculations, in order to predict bike sharing data. 

The template of Jupyter notebook was provided by the Udacity team. I claim credit only 
for the sections specified under the `####TODO` comment lines, i.e. forward and backward propagation calculations, and tuning the 
parameters of model.
